## üìù Conclusion

The case highlights the importance of aligning product performance, customer behavior, and sentiment data. Key findings show that:

- Cities vary widely in tone and expressiveness despite similar star metrics

This type of multi-faceted analysis can inform product strategy, retention efforts, and region-specific marketing priorities.
